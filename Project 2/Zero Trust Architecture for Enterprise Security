Core Principle: Zero Trust operates on the rule "Never Trust, Always Verify," requiring explicit authentication and authorization for every access request, regardless of location.

Identity Foundation: The architecture is built on robust Identity & Access Management (IAM), utilizing mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to enforce the principle of least privilege.

Containment Strategy: Micro-segmentation is used to limit unauthorized lateral movement by treating every network segment as hostile, minimizing the potential "blast radius" of a breach.

Policy Enforcement: Access decisions are dynamic and context-aware, based on multiple data points including user identity, device health, and location, as demonstrated by the conditional access policy simulation.
